These notebooks display my approach to compete in the first stage of the [Kaggle Data Science Bowl 2017](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2017/data).

> The competition task is to create an automated method capable of determining whether or not the patient will be diagnosed with lung cancer within one year of the date the scan was taken. The ground truth labels were confirmed by pathology diagnosis.

With these notebooks I score a **Log Loss of 0.66376** on the submission data, which currently ranks 620th on the public leaderboard.
